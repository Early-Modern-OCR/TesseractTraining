<p>Training files produced for and by the Tesseract OCR engine for work on the Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP)</p>


<h2>Dictionaries:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Raw</b>: This folder contains raw, word list files gathered from a variety of sources</li>
<ul>
The following files were collected from various sources by Ted Underwood and pass on to us. Most are not simple word lists and contain words counts, alternate spellings, etc.
<li><i>addToDictionary.txt</i></li>
<li><i>gazetteer.txt</i></li>
<li><i>maindict.txt</i></li>
<li><i>romannumerals.txt</i></li>
<li><i>SyncopeRules.txt</i></li>
<li><i>VariantSpellings.txt</i></li>
</ul>
<br />

<ul>
The following files were generated by eMOP using an R program to count word frequecy from the Text Creation Partnership (TCP) corpus of hand-transcribed texts.
<li><i>ecco-TCP-word-freq.txt</i></li>
<li><i>eebo-TCP-word-freq.txt</i></li>
</ul>
<br />

<ul>
The following file was gathered from the VARD tool of early modern variant spelling.
<li><i>variants.txt</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
The following file was sent to us by Martin Muller who extracted this file of alternate spellings using MorphAdorner. It is broken up by time periods.
<li><i>emopspellings.txt</i></li>
</ul>

<li><b>Cleaned</b>: This folder contains cleaned up versions of the Raw files, with just the words left.</li>

<li><b>Combos</b>: This folder contains alphabetically sorted word lists that are combinations of the cleaned lists with all duplicates removed. Files with a suffix of "-CSU" have been cleaned, sorted, and all entries are unique (no duplicates). Files that are underlined and bold, are what we have used in eMOP as the basis for our freq-dawg and word-dawg word lists when training Tesseract to run on the eMOP data set of 45 million page images.</li>
<ul>
<li><i>FullDict-184k.txt</i>: A combination of all cleaned files received from Ted Underwood (addToDictionary, gazetteer, maindict, romannumerals, SyncopeRules, and VariantSpellings).</li>
<li><i>FullDict-wVariants-CSU</i>: A combination of FullDict-184k.txt and the cleaned variants.txt culled from VARD (variants-CSU.txt). Cleaned, sorted, and unique.</li>
<li><i>TCP-words-btwn100-499.txt</i>, <i>TCP-words-gt100.txt</i>, <i>TCP-words-gt500.txt</i>: Are combinations of the word lists we compiled from the TCP for both EEBO and ECCO documents, and split into various word-frequency ranges.</li>
<li><i>TCP-words-GT-100-wVariants-CSU.txt</i>: A combination of EEBO and ECCO TCP words, with variants-CSU.txt. Cleaned, sorted and unique.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>After much testing with Tesseract of all these various files, combination files, and other combinations, we finally decided on using:
<ul>
<li><b><i>FullDict-wVariants-CSU.txt</i></b> as our main word list (<b>word-dawg</b>), and </li>
<li><b><i>TCP-words-gt500.txt</i></b> as our frequently used word list (<b>freq-dawg</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
