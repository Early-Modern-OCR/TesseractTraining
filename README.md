<h1>TesseractTraining</h1>

<p>Training files produced for and by the Tesseract OCR engine for work on the Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP)</p>


<h2>Dictionaries:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Raw</b>: This folder contains raw, word list files gathered from a variety of sources</li>
<ul>
The following files were collected from various sources by Ted Underwood and pass on to us. Most are not simple word lists and contain words counts, alternate spellings, etc
<li>addToDictionary.txt</li>
<li>gazetteer.txt</li>
<li>maindict.txt</li>
<li>romannumerals.txt</li>
<li>SyncopeRules.txt</li>
<li>VariantSpellings.txt</li>
</ul>

<ul>
The following files were generated by eMOP using an R program to count word frequecy from the Text Creation Partnership (TCP) corpus of hand-transcribed texts 
<li>ecco-TCP-word-freq.txt</li>
<li>eebo-TCP-word-freq.txt</li>
</ul>

<ul>
The following file was gathered from the VARD tool of early modern variant spelling.
<li>variants.txt</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Cleaned</b>: This folder contains cleaned up versions of the Raw files, with just the words left.</li>

<li><b>Combos</b>: This folder contains alphabetically sorted word lists that are combinations of the cleaned lists with all duplicates removed. Files with a suffix of "-CSU" have been cleaned, sorted, and all entries are unique (no duplicates). Files that are underlined and bold, are what we have used in eMOP as the basis for our freq-dawg and word-dawg word lists when training Tesseract to run on the eMOP data set of 45 million page images.</li>
<ul>
<li>FullDict-184k.txt: A combination of all cleaned files received from Ted Underwood (addToDictionary, gazetteer, maindict, romannumerals, SyncopeRules, and VariantSpellings).</li>
<li>FullDict-wVariants-CSU: A combination of FullDict-184k.txt and the cleaned variants.txt culled from VARD (variants-CSU.txt). Cleaned, sorted, and unique.</li>
<li>TCP-words-btwn100-499.txt, TCP-words-gt100.txt, TCP-words-gt500.txt: Are combinations of the word lists we compiled from the TCP for both EEBO and ECCO documents, and split into various word-frequency ranges.</li>
<li>TCP-words-GT-100-wVariants-CSU.txt: A combination of EEBO and ECCO TCP words, with variants-CSU.txt. Cleaned, sorted and unique.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>After much testing with Tesseract of all these various files, combination files, and other combinations, we finally decided on using:
<ul>
<li><b>FullDict-wVariants-CSU.txt</b> as our main word list (<b>word-dawg</b>), and </li>
<li><b>TCP-words-gt500.txt</b> as our frequently used word list (<b>freq-dawg</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
